## The story begins...

I was sitting in the ninth row on the left side of the bus when  “STOP REQUESTED” broadcasted across the center aisle’s panel of red LEDs.  

Half asleep, I felt as if I’d been transported into a photo darkroom. The faint relief of the passing highway’s landscape  disappeared behind the refracting glow against my window. 

Stop requested? I thought, yawning silently. This journey didn’t have anymore en-route stops. This was the last leg of the Greyhound to Montreal, from New York City— and we weren’t due to cross the border for another hour.
